Created to:
- try out Typescript and React, building on an old project from 2019
- try out a different kind of backend, using Python and FastAPI
- Improve understanding of Redux and Context
- Managing bigger data sets
- Ultimate goal is to deploy this app, perhaps on AWS. Expecting it to be tricky as I'll have a database to consider.
